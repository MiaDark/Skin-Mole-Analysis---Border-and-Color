# Skin-Mole-Analysis---Border-and-Color
Four files including code for analyzing images of skin moles. (Segmentation, calculating Box counting dimension, converting to Lab, XYZ, HSV and YCbCr color space, analysis of the different channels and statistical analysis of the acquired results).

The hausDim function is written by Alceu Ferraz Costa. It is converted to python for this analysis. 
## Features
- **Segmentation of moles**: Extract the mole region from the background.
- **Calculating Box-counting dimension**
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate statistical differences between benign and malignant moles based on box-counting dimensions.
- **Color Space Analysis**: Feature extraction from different color spaces to analyze properties of skin moles.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate statistical differences between benign and malignant moles based on color characteristics.

## Color Spaces Used
- HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)
- Lab (L*, a*, b*)
- XYZ (X, Y, Z)
- YCbCr (Y, Cb, Cr)
